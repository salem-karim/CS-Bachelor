## PechaKucha Presentation

- What is a PK ?  
  A PK (PechaKucha) presentation is a format of presentation, which only consists on 20 very simple slides,  
  often just pictures or icons with minimal Text being shown. These Slides also are only shown for 20 seconds.  

- Advantages and Disadvantages of PechaKucha
  - Advantages  
    Its very short at only 6 minutes and 40 seconds of presentation time, making it very dynamic.  
    As only simple images with minimal Text are used its visual and attractive for the audience.  
    Since there is less then 7 minutes of time the presenter needs to practice the presentation, making it better.  

  - Disadvantages  
    Because its so short you can't present as much material as more traditional presentations.  
    Finding 20 well chosen images can be very hard and its also limiting in content that can be used.  
    It needs a lot of practice as so you dont take up too much time talking on one slide.  

- What advice does the presenter give on making a PK?  
  Embracing the limitations of PK so that you can focus more on your creativity and practice the presentation.  
  Find the Story you want to tell, split it apart into 20 pieces and lastly find images for each part.  

- What do you think of this alternative presentation format and why?  
  You can focus on practicing the presentation itself. The layout is simpler than normal ones.  
  There aren't that many Presentations where you really need more than 7 minutes,  
  this forces you to simplify your "story" as much as possible.  
  If you still need a lot of information a slide on a presentation is not really the place for this,  
  so I would rather like to put it on a separate text Document.

## Business Types and Critical Case Studies  

1. **Sole Proprietorship**: Owned and managed by one individual.  
   Simple to set up, but the owner bears full liability for debts and obligations. Limited ability to raise capital.  
   - **Exercise Link**: Not ideal for any of the startups due to the need for significant investment,  
     collaboration, and liability protection.  

2. **Partnership**: Two or more individuals or entities share ownership, management, and profits.  
   Can have shared or limited liability. Flexible but may face conflicts or continuity issues.  
   - **Exercise Link**: Suitable for the **Engineering Consulting Firm**,  
     as it relies on the expertise and collaboration of two engineers.  

3. **Publicly Listed Corporations**: A separate legal entity with shareholders who have limited liability.  
   Can raise capital through stock sales. Complex to set up and run, with strict regulatory and tax requirements.  
   - **Exercise Link**: Suitable for the **Renewable Energy Startup** and **Autonomous Vehicle Technology Development**,  
     as both require significant capital and global scalability.  

4. **Private Limited Liability Companies**: Combines features of partnerships and corporations.  
   Owners (members) have limited liability and enjoy tax flexibility.  
   Easier to manage than corporations but may struggle to raise capital.  
   - **Exercise Link**: Suitable for the **Sustainable Construction Materials Company**,  
     as it offers liability protection and flexibility for a small to medium-sized business.  

5. **Cooperatives (Co-op)**: Member-owned with democratic governance. Profits are shared based on participation.  
   Common in agriculture, retail, and housing. Challenges include raising capital and member engagement.  
   - **Exercise Link**: Not ideal for the startups, as they require centralized decision-making and significant capital investment.  

6. **Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs)**: Operate for social, charitable, or educational purposes.  
   Surplus revenues are reinvested. Tax-exempt but face strict regulatory scrutiny.  
   - **Exercise Link**: Not applicable to the startups, as they are profit-driven ventures.  

7. **State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)**: Owned and operated by the government to undertake commercial activities.  
   May face challenges like inefficiency or political interference.  
   - **Exercise Link**: Not relevant to the startups, as they are privately initiated ventures.  

8. **Joint Venture**: A collaboration between two or more parties for a specific task or project.  
   Allows risk-sharing and resource pooling but requires clear agreements and alignment of interests.  
   - **Exercise Link**: Suitable for the **Autonomous Vehicle Technology Development**,  
     as it involves collaboration with automotive manufacturers and tech companies.  

9. **Franchise**: A franchisor grants a franchisee the rights to operate under its brand and business model.  
   Allows rapid expansion with lower capital risk for the franchisor.  
   - **Exercise Link**: Not applicable to the startups,  
     as they focus on innovation and product development rather than replication.  

10. **Trust**: A fiduciary arrangement where a trustee manages assets for beneficiaries.  
    Used for estate planning, asset protection, or charitable purposes. Offers tax advantages and asset protection.  
    - **Exercise Link**: Not relevant to the startups, as they are commercial ventures.  

11. **Unincorporated Association**: A simple, informal group for a common purpose (e.g., clubs or societies).  
    Members share liability, and it has limited legal capacity or funding options.  
    - **Exercise Link**: Not suitable for the startups, as they require formal structures and liability protection.  

12. **Social Enterprise**: Combines a social mission with a market-driven approach. Profits are reinvested into social goals.  
    Can take various legal forms and faces challenges in balancing profitability and impact.  
    - **Exercise Link**: Suitable for the **Sustainable Construction Materials Company**, as it aligns with environmental and social goals.
