## PechaKucha Presentation

- What is a PK ?
  A PK (PechaKucha) presentation is a format of  presentation, which only consists on 20 very simple slides, 
  often just pictures or icons with minimal Text being shown. These Slides also are only shown for 20 seconds. 

- Advantages and disadvantages of PechaKucha
  - Advantages
    Its very short at only 6 minutes and 40 seconds of presentation time, making it very dynamic. 
    As only simple images with minimal Text are used its visual and attractive for the audience. 
    Since there is less then 7 minutes of time the presenter needs to practice the presentation, making it better. 

  - Disadvantages
    Because its so short you can't present as much material as more traditional presentations. 
    Finding 20 well chosen images can be very hard and its also limiting in content that can be used. 
    It needs a lot of practice as so you dont take up too much time talking on one slide. 

- What advice does the presenter give on making a PK?
  Embracing the limitations of PK so that you can focus more on your creativity and practice the presentation. 
  Find the Story you want to tell, split it apart into 20 pieces and lastly find images for each part. 

- What do you think of this alternative presentation format and why?
  You can focus on practicing the presentation itself. The layout is simpler than normal ones. 
  There aren't that many Presentations where you really need more than 7 minutes,
  this forces you to simplify your "story" as much as possible. 
  If you still need a lot of information a slide on a presentation is not really the place for this,
  so I would rather like to put it on a separate text Document.
